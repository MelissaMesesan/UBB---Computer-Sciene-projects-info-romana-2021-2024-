                void* f(void* p){
                        printf("%d\n",*(int*)p);
                        return NULL;
                }
 
                int main(){
                        int i;
                        pthread_t t[3];
                        int* x,z;
 
                        z = (int*) malloc(15*sizeof(int));
                        for (i = 0 ; i < 3; i++){
                                 x = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int));
                                *x = i;
                                pthread_create(&t[i],NULL,f,x);
 
                        }
 
                        for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){
                                pthread_join(t[i],NULL);
                        }
 
                return 0;
                }
15. Add the necessary code so that the sum is calculated correctly.
                int sum = 0;
                void *f(void * arg){
                        sum++;
                }
 
                int main(){
                                int i;
                                pthread_t t[10];
                               
                                for(i = 0 ; i < 10; i++){
                                                                pthread_create(&t[i],NULL,f,NULL);
                                }
                               
                                for (i = 0 ; i < 10; i++)
                                                                pthread_join(t[i],NULL);
                                }
 
                                return 0;
                        }
La 16 parca trebuia sa dai 2 exemple de alocare de memorie virtuala.
La 17 din cate imi amintesc trebuia sa scrii componentele teoretice (in pesudocod) ale semaphorului.
La 18 era o problema cu semaphors.
La 19 nu sunt sigur.
La 20 trebuia sa dai o metoda care rezolva deadlock.
 
Bafta ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
