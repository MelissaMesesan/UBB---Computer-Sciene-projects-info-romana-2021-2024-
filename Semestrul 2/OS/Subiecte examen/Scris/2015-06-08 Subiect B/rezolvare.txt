Breakdown: BEGIN = do all computations from the code block following this keyword BEFORE parsing through the lines of the file.
FS=":" = change the field separator to : (basically, use : as separator between words, instead of space).
END = do all computations from the code block following this keyword AFTER parsing through the lines of the file.

4 (children) + 6 (subchildren) + 4 (subsubchildren) + 1 (subsubsubchild) = 15 processes (parent doesn't count because of how the problem is phrased).
Parent creates 4 children.
  1st child has 3 more forks, so it creates 3 subchildren.
    1st subchild has 2 more forks, so it creates 2 subsubchildren.
      1st subsubchild has 1 more fork, so it creates 1 subsubsubchild.
    2nd subchild has 1 more fork, so it creates 1 subsubchild.
  2nd child has 2 more forks, so it creates 2 subchildren.
    1st subchild has 1 more fork, so it creates 1 subsubchild.
  3rd child has 1 more fork, so it creates 1 subchild.

C - child.
CC - subchild.
CCC - subsubchild.
CCCC - subsubsubchild.

Or, if you're a normal human being, you'll use this formula: no. of processes = (2^number_of_forks) - 1.

7. 
~ - home directory
../ - go up one level
./ - in current directory.
-----
~/../ = go up one level from home, so go /home/scs/abie/
~/../../ = go up 2 levels from home, so go /home/scs/
~../.././ = in /home/scs/, go into the xyz folder.
-----
current directory will be /home/scs/xyz. pwd will print precisely that.

8. 0 means false when evaluating an expression, but in the case of evaluating a program's return code, 0 signifies that the program terminated successfully, while anything other than 0 signifies that an error occured.

    echo Err. >&2
    exit 1

10. Exec replaces the current process image with that of the program it executes (basically, if there's no error, exec stops your program and launches the program you pass as argument to the exec function).

11. mkfifo("fifo_string_name", fifo_rights_flag);
fifo_rights_flag = what rights the FIFO file should have (usually 600, meaning rw- for user, no rights for group/others).

12. If O_NDELAY is not set, then the read function will wait until a write operation is performed, in the pipe. Since the pipe is empty, the program will freeze, because read will wait indefinitely.

13. The status of a process may go from RUN to WAIT because it had reached the allowed time limit for being on the CPU, so it gets taken off of it and another process gets to execute. Alternatively, a process could be set to WAIT if another process with higher priority was launched. Depends on the process scheduling that the system has in place.

14. z can be deallocated at any given time, after it is allocated, because it is never used. A good rule of thumb would be to deallocate it in the same thread it was created in (which, in our case, is the main one), since the other threads do not use it.

x should be deallocated in the thread function (deallocating it in the main thread will most likely lead to the thread accessing a freed memory area), after the printf.

15. Not 100% sure what gets added to the sum. Guessing it adds the "index" of the thread that's currently executing. The code for that would be:

pthread_mutex_t mtx;

int sum = 0;

void *f(void * arg)
{
    int* val = (int*)arg;

    pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx); // avoid having multiple threads modify the same variable simultaneously
    sum += *val;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx);

    free(val);
}

int main()
{
    int i;
    pthread_t t[10];

    pthread_mutex_init(&mtx, NULL);
   
    for(i = 0 ; i < 10; i++)
    {
    	int* pos = (int*)malloc(sizeof(i)); // use dynamic allocation to pass the index, because the value of i gets modified after passing it as argument; remember that we are passing by address, not by value
    	*pos = i;
        pthread_create(&t[i], NULL, f, pos);
    }
   
    for (i = 0 ; i < 10; i++)
        pthread_join(t[i],NULL);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mtx);

    return 0;
}

16. Virtual paged (split programs into virtual pages, and RAM into physical pages. CPU gets virtual page/offset + page table and returns the physical page/offset), virtual segmented (rarely found in pure form, in practice; the programs are split into logical modules, which benefit from access control).

17. A semaphore contains a non-negative integer variable, semval, which keeps track of the unit amounts of a resource. Basically, semval == 0 means the resource is unavailable. semval > 0 means you currently have semval units left of that resource. Alternatively, if you use a binary semaphore, semval == 0 means the resource is unavailable, while semval == 1 means the resource is available. See more at

20. In the case of mutex deadlocks, lock mutexes in the same order across all threads, and avoid calling functions that might come back to the same thread function.
